# GDP and Life Expectancy Analysis

## Introduction

This project explores the relationship between Gross Domestic Product (GDP) and life expectancy across several countries. Using data visualization techniques, we aim to uncover trends and patterns in how economic prosperity impacts the well-being of populations.

## Background Information

### What is GDP?
Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is the total monetary value of all goods and services produced within a country in a specific period. It is often used as an indicator of a country's economic health.

### Sources of Data
**World Health Organization and the World Bank** 

Additional research and resources were used to validate the data.

## Visualizations

### 1. Life Expectancy Distribution by Country
A violin plot illustrates the distribution of life expectancy values for each country. This visualization highlights the spread and density of life expectancy data.

### 2. Correlation Between GDP and Life Expectancy

This scatterplot shows the relationship between GDP and life expectancy for each country.

### 3. GDP and Life Expectancy Over Time

#### GDP Over Time (by Country)
A facet grid of line graphs that maps GDP trends for each country over time.

#### Life Expectancy Over Time (by Country)
A facet grid of line graphs showing how life expectancy has evolved for each country over time.

## Key Findings
- Wealthier countries, as measured by GDP, tend to have higher life expectancies.
- Developing countries exhibit more variability in life expectancy compared to developed nations.
- Zimbabwe, a low-GDP country, shows significantly lower life expectancy, highlighting disparities.

## Limitations
- The data does not account for all countries worldwide, which may limit generalizability.
- Factors beyond GDP, such as healthcare access and social conditions, are not explored in-depth.
- The time range of the dataset may exclude recent developments or trends.

## Further Research
Future studies could incorporate:
- The role of healthcare expenditure in influencing life expectancy.
- The impact of inequality (Gini coefficient) on life expectancy.
- Comparisons of regional trends within continents.
